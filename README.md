## What it is

One Rust server beside a stock rbitcoin node (v0.9.2), serving a Solid frontend and an Esplora-compatible API for mainnet, signet and testnet4 (regtest for development). It shows blocks, the live mempool with projected blocks and fee recommendations, transactions, addresses, replacements, mining pools and block audits, and the Lightning graph.

rbitcoin already keeps the transaction index, the address index, the cluster mempool and per-transaction fees in one process. So there is no second indexer, no second copy of the mempool and no database server: the explorer talks to the node over Esplora, Electrum and JSON-RPC, keeps the little the node does not store in SQLite, and follows Lightning through a gossip-only LDK peer that holds no funds.

It is nearing its first release, `v0.1.0`. What is left is in [`docs/COMPAT.md`](docs/COMPAT.md#what-is-left).

## Run it

On a Linux host with Docker and Compose (amd64 or arm64), [`deploy/compose.yml`](deploy/compose.yml) runs rbitcoin v0.9.2 and the explorer side by side. [`docs/DEPLOY.md`](docs/DEPLOY.md#same-host-with-the-compose-file) has the commands, then TLS, the first backfill, upgrades and what to watch. To try it first, the same compose file runs a private regtest chain ([`docs/DEPLOY.md`](docs/DEPLOY.md#try-it-on-regtest-first)).

## Develop

Needs Rust (`rust-toolchain.toml` installs itself through rustup), [bun](https://bun.sh), and, for the regtest node, Docker with Compose v2.23 or later and `python3`.

```sh
# A private regtest node with a known chain (docs/REGTEST.md), and a .env pointing at it.
# For a node of your own, fill in the MAINNET_ lines of .env.example instead (docs/CONFIG.md).
dev/regtest/regtest.py scenario > /dev/null
grep -v '^MAINNET_' .env.example > .env && dev/regtest/regtest.py env >> .env

# Build the frontend and run the server on it: http://127.0.0.1:8080/regtest/
(cd web && bun install && bun run build)
set -a && . ./.env && set +a         # the server reads the environment, never .env itself
cargo run -p rbitcoin-space

# Frontend with hot reload, proxying the server above
(cd web && bun run dev)

# What CI runs
cargo fmt --all --check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test
(cd web && bun run typecheck && bun run lint && bun run test && bun run build && bun run size)
(cd web && bun run format)            # oxfmt rewrites files; `lint` only checks them
(cd web && bun run e2e)               # browser tests; needs Docker
```
