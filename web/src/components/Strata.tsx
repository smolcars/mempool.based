 * (how full the block is, 0–1), and at least one hairline (`min`) so a block with any paying
 * transaction shows something. Where there is room, a layer is never thinner than `min`, so one
 * transaction in a band still shows, its thickness taken from the thicker layers. Where there is
 * not (a nearly empty block), the stack keeps the block's true height and the layers share it by
 * size: the fill height stays honest, and bands too small to see are deliberately not drawn
 * thicker. Empty bands get no layer.
