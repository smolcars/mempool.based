// popover: while a top-layer element shows, iOS Safari repaints the band behind its toolbar and the
// page stops above it (WebKit bug 302272).
//
// A press outside only closes it (`absorb`): the reader is dismissing it, as with a native menu, and
// a tap that also followed the link beneath it took them to another page. The one exception is a
// press on another pop-up of the same kind (`through`): one tap moves an exact amount's note from
// one figure to the next, as it did before, so figures read side by side.
