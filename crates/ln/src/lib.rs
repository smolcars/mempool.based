//! A gossip-only Lightning peer. It connects out to a few public nodes, receives the gossip that
//! describes the public channel graph, and keeps that graph in memory and on disk. It opens no
//! channel, accepts none (every channel message is answered with an error), holds no funds,
//! listens for no inbound connection, does not announce itself and relays nothing.
//! Design and numbers: `docs/LIGHTNING.md`.
//!
//! **Every channel in the graph was checked against the chain** by this process: its funding
//! output exists, is unspent, is at least six blocks deep and pays the two-of-two script of the
//! announced keys. Its capacity ([`ChannelInfo::capacity_sats`]) is that output's value. Channels
//! still being checked, or refused, are not in the graph; [`Status::validation`] counts them.
//! Lookups go to rbitcoin's output-by-position routes through a [`Chain`], batched and
//! rate-limited.
//!
//! **Closed channels leave the graph** when the block that spends their funding output arrives.
//! Opens and closes, each close with how it happened ([`CloseKind`]), are kept as a history:
//! [`Peer::history`] streams it and [`Peer::recent`] keeps the newest records.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # async fn f() -> std::io::Result<()> {
//! use ln::{Config, Peer};
//! let config = Config::new(ln::Network::Bitcoin, "/var/lib/rbitcoin-space/ln".into());
//! let chain = node::esplora::Esplora::new("http://127.0.0.1:3000").map_err(std::io::Error::other)?;
//! let (peer, _loaded) = Peer::start(config, chain)?;
//! let mut events = peer.events();
//! let channels = peer.read(|g| g.channels().len());
