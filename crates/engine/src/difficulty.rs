//! Where the chain is in its difficulty period and what the next retarget is expected to do.
//! Pure arithmetic over three blocks (the tip, this period's first, the previous period's first);
//! the server fetches them. Each network's rules and what the answer means: `docs/API.md`.
//!
//! The consensus rules this follows:
//! - A period is 2016 blocks. The first block of the next period gets new bits.
//! - The retarget measures the time from the period's first block to its last: 2015 intervals,
//!   not 2016, so a period mined at exactly 600 s a block still raises difficulty slightly.
//! - The measured time is clamped to a quarter and four times two weeks, so difficulty moves at
//!   most fourfold either way, and the new target never exceeds the network's proof-of-work limit.
//! - The new target is the old one scaled by the measured time. On mainnet and signet every block
//!   in a period has the same bits. On testnet4, BIP94 scales the period's *first* block, because
//!   the last may be a minimum-difficulty block mined after a 20-minute gap. Using the first
//!   block's bits is therefore right on every network.
//! - Regtest never retargets.
