//! The record of recent replacements: what replaced what, when we saw it, and each side's own
//! figures as the mempool tracker held them. Bounded, oldest out first. The server keeps it in
//! memory, fed from the tracker's change stream, and with a store also in the `replacements`
//! table ([`db`]), so it survives a restart (`docs/MEMPOOL.md`, "The replacement record").
//!
//! Read as chains (what replaced this, and what replaced that) by the `tx:` topic and `/app`, and
//! as trees (a replacement and everything it replaced, recursively) by `/api/v1`.
//!
//! A mined replacement carries its block. The record follows the chain from the tracker's own
//! window of recent blocks ([`Replacements::follow`]), so a reorg reaches it from the same source
//! the tracker trusts; what the window cannot settle is asked of the node, a bounded number of
//! reads per reorg ([`Replacements::asks`], [`ask`]).
