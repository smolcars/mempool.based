//! The block table: one row per block on the best chain, with what the mining dashboard and the
//! history charts need, kept in the network's [`Store`] (`docs/STORE.md`, "blocks").
//!
//! - [`follow`] keeps the newest [`ZONE`] rows in line with the node on every new tip, replacing
//!   rows a reorg made stale, and takes the newest blocks' fee rates from the summary cache.
//! - [`backfill`] fills every older row, newest first, in two tiers: totals and coinbase for
//!   every block (cheap, batched), then fee rates for the recent ones (one block listing each,
//!   through [`Lister`]).
//! - [`by_hash`], [`by_height`], [`page`], [`periods`] and [`heights_between`] read it; the
//!   mining routes read it through [`span`], [`pool_counts`], [`pool_page`] and the rest of
//!   `mining.rs`, and [`reattribute`] redoes its pool column when the pool list changes.
//!
//! The table itself is the backfill's progress: nothing else records how far it got, so a
//! restart redoes no work and a deleted file is rebuilt from the node.
