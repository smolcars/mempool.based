//! What the Lightning gossip peer observes live, kept in the store: every channel's open and
//! close (`ln_channels`), and the network's totals every ten minutes (`ln_statistics`), rolled
//! into hours and days as they age. Tables, bounds and timings: `docs/STORE.md`.
//!
//! The engine does not depend on the `ln` crate: the server turns the peer's history records
//! into [`Change`]s and its graph into [`Stats`].
