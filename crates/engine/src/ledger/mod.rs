//! Running totals the server keeps for a bounded set of very large addresses (docs/STORE.md,
//! "ledger"): the node refuses their totals above its `--max-sh-creates`, or takes minutes for
//! them, so each is asked of the node once ([`seed`]) and then kept by reading every new block
//! once ([`follow`]), whatever the number of scripts tracked.
//!
//! Every tracked script is exact at one block, the ledger's tip. A block is applied to all of them
//! in one write, and the last [`UNDO_DEPTH`] blocks' effects are kept so a reorg is undone
//! exactly. After any sequence of connects, disconnects, restarts and catch-ups, a script's totals
//! equal what the node's `/address/:a?asof=<tip>` answers (the regtest test in `tests.rs` checks
//! this against a real node).
