# WebSocket protocol

The live channel between the server and the frontend: one socket per browser tab at `/app/ws`, or under a network's prefix (`/signet/app/ws`, `/testnet4/app/ws`, `/regtest/app/ws`). A socket belongs to one network. This page is the contract the frontend and every topic are written against. The code is `crates/server/src/ws.rs` and `crates/server/src/ws/`. Wallets and bots written for mempool.space have [their own socket](#the-mempoolspace-shaped-socket-apiv1ws) at `/api/v1/ws`, on the same hub.

The socket is part of the private `/app` API: it may change in any release, since the frontend and server ship together. Breaking changes bump the protocol version.

## Frames

| Frame | Carries |
|---|---|
| Text | One JSON object: control messages and small state |
| Binary | A projected block's transactions ([below](#binary-frames)). Byte 0 is a kind code naming the format of the rest, byte 1 that format's version. A client ignores a binary frame whose kind or version it does not know |

A client sends text frames only. The server ignores the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header and negotiates no extensions, so frames are never compressed.

## Messages

Every server message is an object with a `type`. Messages that belong to a topic also carry `topic`; the others are about the connection. New fields may be added to any message: a client ignores fields it does not know.

### Client to server

| Message | Does |
|---|---|
| `{"op":"subscribe","topics":["blocks"]}` | Subscribes to each topic. The server first sends the topic's current state, if it has one, then every change. Subscribing to a topic already subscribed does nothing |
| `{"op":"unsubscribe","topics":["blocks"]}` | Stops the topics. Unknown to this connection is not an error |
| `{"op":"ping"}` | The server answers `{"type":"pong"}`. For a browser, which cannot send WebSocket pings, to check the socket is alive |

Anything else (not JSON, an unknown `op`, a missing or misspelled field, an unknown topic) closes the socket with `4000`.

### Server to client

| Message | When |
|---|---|
| `{"type":"hello","v":1,"network":"mainnet","tip":{"height":975516,"hash":"…"}}` | First, on every connection. `tip` is the node's best block, or `null` before the server has reached the node |
| `{"type":"pong"}` | Answer to `ping` |
| Topic messages | Below |

## Topics

### `blocks`

| Message | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `{"topic":"blocks","type":"block","block":{…}}` | A block joined the best chain. `block` is the node's Esplora JSON for it, exactly as `GET /api/block/:hash` returns it (`id`, `height`, `previousblockhash`, `timestamp`, `tx_count`, `size`, `weight`, …). Also the snapshot sent on subscribe: the current tip's block |
| `{"topic":"blocks","type":"summary","summary":{…}}` | A block's fee facts, its miner and its audit, exactly as `GET /app/block/:hash/summary` returns them ([`FRONTEND.md`](FRONTEND.md#block-summaries)); `summary.id` names the block, `summary.miner` who mined it and `summary.audit` its health (`null` when it has no audit), so a new tile names its miner and shows its health without asking. A new block's audit is computed before this message is sent: at once on mainnet, at most 5 s later than without it. Sent after the `block` message for each new tip, once it is computed (well under a second on mainnet), and for older blocks the server fills in after a gap or at startup. Never a snapshot: a new subscriber fetches the facts of the tiles it shows over HTTP, from the batch route |
| `{"topic":"blocks","type":"reorg","fork_height":N}` | Every block above `N` left the best chain. `block` messages for the new branch follow, in height order |
| `{"topic":"blocks","type":"resync","tip":{"height":…,"hash":"…"}}` | Blocks may have been missed: the server lost and regained the node, or could not fetch a new block within 3 seconds. `tip` is the best block now, or `null`. After a failed fetch it is also the snapshot, until the next `block` |

**Keeping up.** Keep the height and hash of the newest block shown. On `block`:

- `height` is one more and `previousblockhash` is the kept hash: append it.
- `height` is at or below the kept height: a reorg replaced blocks. Drop those at and above `height`, then append.
- Anything else is a gap: fetch the recent blocks over HTTP (`GET /api/blocks`).

On `reorg`, drop blocks above `fork_height`. On `resync`, compare `tip` with what is shown and, if it differs, fetch over HTTP. After a reconnect, `hello` and the subscribe snapshot give the tip again; compare as for `resync`.

A `block` message is about 500 bytes whatever the block's size: transactions are not included. The server fetches each new block's JSON in one loop, whatever the number of subscribers: it asks the node's Esplora every 25 ms until the block is served, for at most 3 seconds (120 requests), then sends `resync` instead. A `summary` message is about 700 bytes with its audit. Key it by `summary.id`; one whose block is not shown can be dropped.

### Mempool topics

Fed by the network's mempool tracker and projected blocks ([`MEMPOOL.md`](MEMPOOL.md#in-the-server)). Each topic sends at most one message per `WS_MEMPOOL_INTERVAL_MS` (2 s), always the latest state, so changes in between are merged. The exception is a new block: the state on it goes out at once ([below](#when-a-block-is-found)). Nothing is sent before the tracker's first complete cycle; a subscriber then gets the current state on subscribe, as for `blocks`.

| Topic | For | Format | Size on mainnet |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mempool` | The home page's mempool panel | JSON, the whole state each time | about 200 bytes |
| `projected` | The block strip's projected tiles | JSON, the whole state each time | about 1.4 KB |
| `transactions` | The home page's latest transactions | JSON, the whole list each time | about 1.4 KB |
| `fees` | The home page's "Fee to pay now" panel | JSON, the whole state each time, only when it changed | about 390 bytes, one or two a minute |
| `projected-txs:0` to `projected-txs:6` | One projected block's grid | Binary: a snapshot, then deltas | snapshot 48 bytes a transaction; see [Cost](#cost-of-the-mempool-topics) |

With `{NET}_MEMPOOL_ENABLED=false` every one of them but `fees` answers subscribe with `{"topic":"…","type":"off"}` and nothing else; `fees` then carries the node's own estimates.

Rates are integers in **sat per 1,000 vB**, the node's own unit and resolution (`1234` is 1.234 sat/vB); sizes are sigop-adjusted virtual bytes; amounts are satoshis.

**`mempool`**

```json
{"topic":"mempool","type":"mempool","seq":812,"count":55210,"vsize":41503331,"fees":20125872,
 "min_fee_rate":1000,"bands":[25411234,…10 values],"stale":false}
```

`count`, `vsize` and `fees` are the whole mempool. `min_fee_rate` is the node's `mempoolminfee`, the lowest rate it accepts now (`null` before the first answer). `bands` is the virtual size in each of the ten fee bands of [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md#fee-scale), cheapest first, by each transaction's effective rate: the mempool bar. `stale` is true while the node is failing: the numbers are the last good ones. `seq` is the projection they come from.

**`projected`**

```json
{"topic":"projected","type":"projected","seq":812,"tip":{"height":975530,"hash":"…"},"stale":false,
 "blocks":[{"txs":3214,"weight":3991876,"vsize":997969,"fees":1543210,"min_rate":1012,
            "median_rate":1500,"max_rate":250000,"bands":[0,0,0,0,312000,…]}, … 8 blocks]}
```

Eight blocks, the next first; the last holds everything beyond the other seven (the "+N blocks" tile). `tip` is the block they were projected on. `median_rate` is the rate at the block's middle vbyte; `bands` are its strata. `stale` as above. Key the tiles by position: block 0 is always "next".

**`transactions`**

```json
{"topic":"transactions","type":"transactions",
 "txs":[{"txid":"…","time":1794461221,"fee":381,"vsize":127,"value":4999999619}, …]}
```

The newest `WS_LATEST_TXS` (10) transactions the server has seen, newest first by the node's acceptance `time` (Unix seconds). `value` is the total output value. A transaction stays in the list after it confirms or is replaced; it leaves when newer ones push it out. Rows already shown keep their place: diff by `txid` to find the new ones.

**`fees`**

```json
{"topic":"fees","type":"fees","source":"projected","tip":{"height":975530,"hash":"…"},
 "levels":[{"name":"high","blocks":1,"minutes":10,"rate":2001},
           {"name":"medium","blocks":3,"minutes":30,"rate":1031},
           {"name":"low","blocks":6,"minutes":60,"rate":126},
           {"name":"no_rush","blocks":144,"minutes":1440,"rate":100}],
 "min_fee_rate":100}
```

What to pay to be mined within each horizon ([`MEMPOOL.md`](MEMPOOL.md#fee-recommendations)). `levels` is always these four, fastest first, each with its horizon in blocks and in minutes at one block per ten; `rate` is in sat per 1,000 vB like every rate here, never below `min_fee_rate` (the node's minimum) and never below a slower level's. `source` is `projected` for our own, or `node` for the node's own estimates, which are served for the first five minutes after the server starts, while the projection is stale, and with the engine off; `tip` is the block ours was projected on, `null` for the node's. When neither can be served, the message is `{"topic":"fees","type":"unavailable"}` and stays until one can: show no number then rather than an old one. Each message replaces the last; nothing needs to be kept between them.

**`projected-txs:N`**

Block `N` of `projected`, 0 to 6. The last block has no topic: it is the rest of the mempool and has no size bound. One socket holds at most `WS_MAX_BLOCK_SUBSCRIPTIONS` (2) of these; switch by subscribing to the new one and unsubscribing from the old. The first message is a snapshot (kind 1), possibly followed at once by up to 16 deltas (kind 2) that bring it to the current state; then a delta whenever the block's transactions change, or a snapshot when that is smaller (a new block usually replaces block 0 whole).

### When a block is found

What a socket subscribed to `blocks` and the mempool topics receives for each new block B, in this order:

1. **`block` for B.**
2. **The mempool topics on B**: `mempool`, `projected` with `tip` B, then each `projected-txs:N` that changed. They hold nothing B confirmed, nothing that spent what a transaction in B spent, and none of those transactions' descendants. They are sent as soon as the server has them, without waiting for the rate limit.
3. **`summary` for B**, whenever it is computed: before, between or after the messages of step 2.

The server keeps that order for every message it sends to subscribers. A projection on B is never sent before B's `block`, and after B's `block` no mempool message on an older tip is sent. One case is outside it: a topic's state sent on subscribe is the latest the server holds. A socket that subscribes in the moment between B's `block` and the projection on B gets the mempool topics' state on the parent. `projected.tip` names that block, and the state on B follows as an ordinary message. A page can therefore say "Block B was found" on the `block` message, and treat the next `projected` (and the `mempool` and `projected-txs:N` that come with it) as the state after B. That includes a quiet or empty mempool, where only the tip moves. The `transactions` topic is not tied to blocks.

**How soon.** Step 2 follows step 1 within milliseconds when the node serves the block at once: 2 ms median and 6 ms at most after the `block` message over 22 blocks on regtest. On mainnet it was 592 ms after the `block` message (one block, 68,000 transactions in the mempool; [`MEMPOOL.md`](MEMPOOL.md#when-a-block-is-found) has the breakdown). The wait is the tracker's poll in progress, if any, reading the new block from the node, asking it for the clusters the block touched, and packing.

**When it cannot.** The server holds a projection that disagrees with the announced block for at most 3 s. If the mempool engine has not reached B by then (the node is failing, or will not serve the block), it sends what it has. That message's `tip` says which block it is on, and `stale` is usually set. After a `reorg` or a `resync` there is no announced block to agree with, so nothing is held until the next `block`.

**Then the refresh.** About a second later on mainnet, the server has asked the node for every cluster again. The few records that refresh corrects (transactions whose chunk changed in ways the block alone does not show) arrive as ordinary changes, at the normal rate.

### Binary frames

Integers are little-endian. A txid is 32 bytes in the order it is written in hex, so hex-encoding the bytes gives the usual txid string.

**Record**, 48 bytes, one transaction:

| Offset | Bytes | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 32 | txid |
| 32 | 4 | effective fee rate, sat per 1,000 vB: the rate of the chunk it is mined in |
| 36 | 4 | sigop-adjusted vsize |
| 40 | 8 | its own fee, satoshis |

**Kind 1, snapshot**: the block's whole state.

| Offset | Bytes | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | kind, `1` |
| 1 | 1 | version, `1` |
| 2 | 1 | block `N` |
| 3 | 1 | zero |
| 4 | 4 | record count |
| 8 | 8 | `seq`: the projection this is |
| 16 | 48 × count | records, in mining order |

**Kind 2, delta**: changes since the previous frame of this topic.

| Offset | Bytes | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | kind, `2` |
| 1 | 1 | version, `1` |
| 2 | 1 | block `N` |
| 3 | 1 | zero |
| 4 | 4 | removed count |
| 8 | 8 | `seq`: the projection this brings the block to |
| 16 | 8 | `prev`: the `seq` of the frame it follows |
| 24 | 4 | set count |
| 28 | 4 | zero |
| 32 | 32 × removed | txids that left the block: confirmed, replaced, evicted, or moved to another block |
| … | 48 × set | records that entered the block or changed rate, size or fee |

**Applying them.** Hold, per block, a map from txid to record and the `seq` of the last frame applied.

- On a snapshot, replace the map and the `seq`, whenever it comes.
- On a delta whose `prev` equals the held `seq`: delete each removed txid, then insert or overwrite each set record, then hold the delta's `seq`. The map is now exactly the server's block.
- On a delta whose `prev` is anything else, or before any snapshot, or one that removes a txid the map does not hold: the client has lost its place. Unsubscribe and subscribe again; the snapshot that follows starts it over.

The server never skips a frame for a subscriber: one that cannot keep up is closed with `4003` instead. So a lost place means a client bug or a reconnect without a fresh subscribe, never a normal event. Draw the grid by sorting on rate, highest first; ties have no meaningful order ([`MEMPOOL.md`](MEMPOOL.md#limits)).

**Falling behind.** A slow client is dropped, not resynchronised: its send queue fills (`WS_SEND_QUEUE` frames) and it is closed with `4003`, as on every topic. Resynchronising would mean holding, per client, what it has missed and sending a slow client a snapshot of up to 800 KB on top; dropping it costs nothing, and its reconnect gets one snapshot through the normal path. Frames are shared, so a full queue holds 64 references, not 64 copies.

### Cost of the mempool topics

**Per client, mainnet,** 2026-11-12, one script client on every mempool topic for 943 s, a mempool of 57,000 to 59,000 transactions, read-only against a synced node:

| Topics | Bytes a second | Messages |
|---|---|---|
| `mempool` | 98 | one per 2.1 s |
| `projected` | 654 | one per 2.1 s |
| `transactions` | 671 | one per 2.1 s |
| **The home page, all three** | **1.4 KB/s** | |
| `projected-txs:0` | 321 after a 166 KB snapshot (3,458 transactions) | a delta per 2.1 s |
| `projected-txs:1` | 582 after a 378 KB snapshot (7,880 transactions) | a delta per 2.1 s |

A second run of 1,760 s, which included block 975,526 (3,663 transactions confirmed), gave the same rates (1.4 KB/s for the home page; 278 and 602 B/s for blocks 0 and 1). At the block each projected block's change was larger than its new state, so both topics sent a snapshot instead: 87 KB for block 0 (1,822 transactions) and 270 KB for block 1. A client watching a block pays that once per block. Throughout, our counts matched the node's `getmempoolinfo` to within 10 transactions (the ones that arrived between our cycle and the check), and our block 0 matched the node's template above 99.7% by weight, tie-aware, at every one of 46 checks.

**Server, at scale,** measured locally only: the release build against a regtest node taking 20 new transactions a second (a block every 3 minutes, mempool up to 3,600 transactions), clients in Python on the same machine (Apple M4, shared with other work). One client in ten also watched `projected-txs:0`.

| Clients | Server CPU | Peak RSS | Queued to clients | Slowest fan-out | Dropped |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| none | 0.2–0.3% of one core | 14–37 MB | | | |
| 1,000 | 2.2% | 18 MB | | | 0 |
| 5,000 | 8.0% | 64 MB | 7 MB/s | 21 ms | 0 |

CPU and memory grow with the clients, not with the topics: each message is encoded once (in that run 139 KB a minute encoded, 424 MB a minute queued) and each client's queue holds references to the same bytes. With one client on mainnet the whole server, engines included, used 2.8% of one core and 80 MB.

### Following a transaction or an address

Two families of topics with a parameter, for the transaction and address pages (`crates/server/src/ws/track.rs`). Each message is the topic's whole state, so a client keeps the last one; the first is sent on subscribe. A client never needs to order or merge them.

| Topic | For | Format |
|---|---|---|
| `tx:<txid>` | Where a transaction is and what happened to it | JSON, the whole state each time, about 300 bytes |
| `address:<address>` | A signal that an address's history changed, so the page refetches | JSON, about 150 bytes |

**Names are parsed strictly.** A txid is exactly 64 hex digits in lower case. An address must be one of this network's; it is echoed in `topic` as the server writes it, with bech32 in lower case (an address typed in upper case comes back lower case), so a page should lower-case a bech32 address before subscribing. Anything else closes the socket with `4000`, like any unknown topic.

**`tx:<txid>`**

Rates are sat per 1,000 vB, as everywhere. `stale` is true while the node is failing: the state is the last good one. One of:

```json
{"topic":"tx:…","type":"tx","stale":false,"state":"mempool","time":1794461221,"fee":381,"vsize":127,"rate":3000,
 "position":{"block":0,"blocks":8,"effective_rate":3000,"ahead_vsize":412311,"ahead_txs":1022}}
{"topic":"tx:…","type":"tx","stale":false,"state":"replaced","by":"<txid>","truncated":false,
 "chain":[{"txid":"<this>","by":"<B>","seen":1794461300,"fee":381,"vsize":127,"rate":3000,"by_fee":900,"by_vsize":127,"by_rate":7086},
          {"txid":"<B>","by":"<C>", …}]}
{"topic":"tx:…","type":"tx","stale":false,"state":"confirmed","height":975530,"hash":"…"}
{"topic":"tx:…","type":"tx","stale":false,"state":"evicted"}
{"topic":"tx:…","type":"tx","stale":false,"state":"unknown"}
```

| `state` | Means | The page |
|---|---|---|
| `mempool` | In the node's mempool. `time` is when the node accepted it; `fee`, `vsize` and `rate` are its own. `position` is where the projected blocks put it, `null` for the moment before they have placed it | Shows the position (below) |
| `replaced` | It left because `by` spent one of its inputs, or one of its ancestors' (a child leaves with its replaced parent and carries the same replacement). `chain` runs from this transaction to the newest replacement known: follow the last link's `by`, and subscribe to that one to see where it is. A later replacement of the end grows the chain, and the server sends the longer one. Figures are as the tracker knew them; `by_fee` and `by_vsize` are `null` when the replacement was confirmed in the block that removed this one. A link known only from the tracker's reason, after the record dropped it, has only `txid` and `by`. At most 32 links; `truncated` says there were more | Offers the newest replacement |
| `confirmed` | Mined in block `hash` at `height`. A reorg that takes the block away brings it back to `mempool`, or to `unknown` if the node does not take it back. After the server lost track of the chain (a reconnect to the node, a reorg deeper than it follows) it also says `unknown` rather than vouch for an old confirmation | Shows the block |
| `evicted` | It left the mempool for a reason the node does not report: evicted for size, expired after two weeks, dropped after a reorg, or replaced by a transaction we did not see ([`MEMPOOL.md`](MEMPOOL.md#where-it-can-only-infer)) | Says it is no longer in the mempool |
| `unknown` | Not in the mempool, and the server has no record of why: confirmed before anyone followed it here, never seen, or gone while the server was not following it. The server asks the node nothing to find out | Asks `GET /api/tx/:txid/status`, the page's own route for confirmed data, and again on each new block. The topic says `mempool` if it arrives later |

**The position.** `block` is the projected block, 0 for the next; the last one (`blocks` − 1) holds everything beyond the others. `ahead_vsize` and `ahead_txs` are what would be mined before it, earlier blocks included. Say "in the next block" for block 0, "in about N blocks" (N = `block` + 1) for the others, and "in more than `blocks` − 1 blocks" for the last; never a time to the minute. The projection is the node's own template rule applied to its own chunks and matched the node's template above 99.7% by weight in every check ([`MEMPOOL.md`](MEMPOOL.md#agreement-with-the-node)), but miners pick their own blocks and break ties their own way. On mainnet, a transaction in the large class of identical cheap chunks moves between later blocks every few seconds: that is the projection's honest uncertainty. `effective_rate` is the rate of the chunk it will be mined in, so a parent lifted by a child shows the child's chunk rate here and its own in `rate`.

**How often.** The server reconsiders every followed transaction at most once per `WS_MEMPOOL_INTERVAL_MS`, from the same projection the other mempool topics use, and a newly followed one at once (its first message comes within milliseconds). It publishes only from a view of the engines that matches the removal reasons it has folded in, so a transaction never reads as waiting after the server has seen it leave. A change of state, a new effective rate, or entering or leaving the next block goes out at once. A change of only how much is ahead of it, or of which later block it is in, goes out at most once per `WS_POSITION_INTERVAL_MS` (10 s): enough for a page to keep its estimate fresh, without a message for every shuffle.

**`address:<address>`**

```json
{"topic":"address:bc1q…","type":"address","state":"watching","status":"6c3e…"}
{"topic":"address:bc1q…","type":"address","state":"unavailable"}
{"topic":"address:bc1q…","type":"address","state":"refused","reason":"too_large"}
```

| `state` | Means |
|---|---|
| `watching` | The node watches it. `status` is the node's Electrum status of the address's history (`null` for an address with none): it changes whenever a payment to or from it enters the mempool or confirms, and with a reorg. Refetch what the page shows when it differs from the last one. Subscribe first, then fetch, so nothing falls between |
| `unavailable` | The node cannot be reached, or the connection to it dropped: the last status may be out of date. When the connection is back the server asks again and sends `watching` with the status as it is then |
| `refused` | The node will not watch it. `reason` is `too_large` (more history than the node's `--max-sh-creates`: the page can still page its history over HTTP but gets no live signal), `no_index` (the node runs without `--sh-index`), `server_full` (the node's own subscription cap) or `refused` (any other refusal). Final until the page subscribes again |

No message is sent until the node has answered, normally a few milliseconds after subscribing. One node subscription serves every socket following the address, and it is dropped when the last one leaves; one whose request is still in flight then keeps its place under `WS_TRACKED_ADDRESSES_TOTAL` until the node answers, so sockets subscribing and leaving fast cannot pile up requests on the node.

**Bounds.** One socket may follow `WS_MAX_TRACKED_TXS` (4) transactions and `WS_MAX_TRACKED_ADDRESSES` (2) addresses, inside `WS_MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS`; over either, close `4001`. A network follows at most `WS_TRACKED_TXS_TOTAL` (10,000) distinct transactions and `WS_TRACKED_ADDRESSES_TOTAL` (1,000) distinct addresses. Past those the socket is sent `{"topic":"tx:…","type":"refused","reason":"server_full"}` (or the same for an address), is not subscribed, and stays open: try again later. When the last socket following a transaction or address unsubscribes or closes, the server forgets it, its stored message and, for an address, the node's subscription.

**With the mempool engine off** (`{NET}_MEMPOOL_ENABLED=false`), `tx:<txid>` answers `{"topic":"tx:…","type":"off"}` and nothing else. Addresses do not need the engine and work either way. Before the tracker's first complete cycle a `tx:` topic sends nothing, rather than a state it cannot vouch for.

**Recovery.** Nothing to do: every message is complete. After a reconnect, subscribe again and the first message is the current state.

**Cost.** A followed transaction asks the node nothing: its state comes from the tracker's records and removal reasons, the projected blocks and the replacement record ([`MEMPOOL.md`](MEMPOOL.md#following-a-transaction)), all already in memory. Measured locally on the release build against regtest (5,000 transactions in the mempool, Apple M4 shared with other work), 5,000 sockets each following a different transaction:

| | |
|---|---|
| Node calls a minute, nobody connected | 18 (2.01 MB), no cluster requests |
| Node calls a minute, 5,000 followers, mempool unchanged | 18 (2.01 MB), no cluster requests: the same |
| Every socket has its first message | within the 5 s it took to open them |
| Server RSS | 17 MB idle, 38 MB with the 5,000 sockets open, 70 MB at the peak of the next two minutes |
| Server CPU | 14% of one core while the sockets opened, 0–4% after |
| A minute of churn (a child paying 100 sat/vB for one of them every 0.5 s) | 29,973 messages, 8.2 MB encoded once, about 6 per transaction: one per position interval |
| The block that confirmed all 5,000 | 5,000 `confirmed` messages; no client dropped |

Over a cap at upgrade time, the request is refused before it becomes a socket: `429` past the per-client cap, `503` past the total. Clients are counted as in [`CONFIG.md`](CONFIG.md#client-addresses) (IPv6 by /64, the trusted proxy header only from a trusted proxy). The upgrade request also passes the ordinary request limits.

**Only this site's pages may open a socket** ([`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) rule 21). A browser always sends `Origin` with an upgrade; the server accepts it only when its host and port equal the request's `Host` (letter case and the scheme's default port ignored), and refuses anything else with `403` `{"error":"websocket refused: Origin is not this site"}` before any socket slot is taken. Without the rule, any website could open sockets from each of its visitors until their per-client cap was reached and lock them out of this one. `Host` is the name the browser used, so every host name the site answers to works without a setting, as long as the reverse proxy passes `Host` through unchanged, port included (nginx: `proxy_set_header Host $http_host`, since `$host` drops a non-default port; Caddy does by default). A proxy that rewrites `Host` to the server's own address makes every browser socket fail: the refusal is an `http_request` with `refused: "origin"` and a `ws_origin_refused` warning naming the origin and host seen ([`LOGGING.md`](LOGGING.md#websocket-hub)). An upgrade without `Origin` is a program, not a browser page, and is allowed: no third party can make a visitor's browser send one.

Browsers answer pings on their own, so a live tab is never closed for silence. A client may send `{"op":"ping"}` every 30 seconds or so to learn that a socket died without a close.

## Close codes

| Code | Reason text | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1000 | `closed by client` | Answer to the client's close |
| 1001 | `server shutting down` | Shutdown. Reconnect with backoff |
| 1002 | `protocol error` | Bad framing: unmasked, reserved bits set, unknown opcode, a fragmented or oversized control frame, a continuation out of place, a close frame with a status an endpoint may not send |
| 1003 | `binary messages are not accepted` | The client sent a binary message |
| 1007 | `invalid utf-8` | A text message, or a close frame's reason, that is not UTF-8 |
| 1009 | `message too big` | A message over `WS_MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES`, refused from the frame header before the payload is read |
| 4000 | `bad message` | Not a message listed above |
| 4001 | `too many subscriptions` | Over `WS_MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS`, `WS_MAX_BLOCK_SUBSCRIPTIONS`, `WS_MAX_TRACKED_TXS` or `WS_MAX_TRACKED_ADDRESSES` |
| 4002 | `too many messages` | Over `WS_MESSAGES_PER_SEC` |
| 4003 | `too slow` | The send queue was full: the client is not reading |
| 4004 | `idle timeout` | Nothing received for `WS_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS`, ping unanswered |

A client closed for 1002 to 4002 has a bug; reconnecting will not help. After 4003 or 4004, reconnect with backoff. The close frame is written after any frame in progress and the queued messages are dropped. When a client has stopped reading, the close frame may never reach it: the write gives up after `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS` without progress and the connection is dropped.

## The mempool.space-shaped socket (`/api/v1/ws`)

For wallets and bots written against mempool.space's WebSocket: `/api/v1/ws` on each network (`/signet/api/v1/ws`, `/testnet4/api/v1/ws`, `/regtest/api/v1/ws`). It runs on the same hub, framing, limits and tracking as `/app/ws` and speaks the reference's JSON, observed from mempool.space ([`compat/websocket.md`](compat/websocket.md)) and held to recorded messages by a test (`every_message_has_the_reference_shape`, against [`fixtures/websocket/reference.json`](../fixtures/websocket/reference.json)). It is a public API: unlike `/app/ws` it may change only to add, and other sites' pages may open it ([below](#why-other-sites-may-open-it)). It is not a drop-in replacement: what it leaves out is [listed](#differences-from-the-reference). The code is `crates/server/src/ws/v1.rs`.

### What a client sends

Text frames with one JSON object. An object may hold several of these keys; each is handled.

| Message | Does |
|---|---|
| `{"action":"ping"}` | Answered `{"pong":true}` |
| `{"action":"want","data":["blocks","stats","mempool-blocks"]}` | Replaces the set of parts wanted; other names are ignored. Each newly wanted part first sends its current state, then every change. `"data":[]` stops them all |
| `{"track-tx":"<txid>"}` | Follows one transaction, 64 hex digits in lower case. A new one replaces the last; `{"track-tx":"stop"}` ends it |
| `{"track-address":"<address>"}` | Follows one address of this network (bech32 in either case). A new one replaces the last; `"stop"` ends it |
| `{"track-addresses":["<address>", …]}` | Follows a set of addresses, replacing the last set; `[]` stops it. Duplicates count once |

What else happens, as on the reference unless it says otherwise:

| A client sends | It gets |
|---|---|
| Text that is not JSON | Close `4000` (the reference closes too, without a status) |
| JSON it does not understand: another type, an unknown key or `action`, a value of the wrong type, a txid or address that does not parse for this network | Nothing; the socket stays |
| `track-mempool`, `track-mempool-txids`, `track-mempool-block`, `track-rbf`, `track-rbf-summary`, `track-txs`, `track-scripthashes`, `track-accelerations` | `{"<key>-error":"not served by this server"}`, and the socket stays. Ours: the reference serves them |
| `{"action":"init"}`, `refresh-blocks` and the reference's other keys | Nothing |

### What the server sends

Every message is one JSON object in its own frame, with the key named here.

| Message | When | What |
|---|---|---|
| `{"blocks":[…]}` | On `want` | The last 8 blocks, oldest first, each the node's Esplora JSON exactly as `GET /api/block/:hash` serves it |
| `{"block":{…}}` | Each new block | The same JSON, at the same moment as `/app/ws`'s `block` |
| `{"mempoolInfo":{…},"fees":{…},"da":{…},"transactions":[…]}` | On `want`, then every `WS_MEMPOOL_INTERVAL_MS` (2 s) | Whatever of these the server has: `mempoolInfo` is the node's `getmempoolinfo` as the mempool tracker last read it, amounts in BTC; `fees` is `GET /api/v1/fees/precise`'s answer and `da` `GET /api/v1/difficulty-adjustment`'s ([`API.md`](API.md#mempoolspace-shaped-routes-apiv1)); `transactions` is the newest `WS_LATEST_TXS` transactions seen, `{txid, fee, vsize, value, rate, time}` with `rate` in sat/vB |
| `{"mempool-blocks":[…]}` | On `want`, then when the projected blocks change | `GET /api/v1/fees/mempool-blocks`' answer. After a `block`, the next one is on that block (held for at most 3 s, as on `/app/ws`) |
| `{"txPosition":{"txid":"…","position":{"block":0,"vsize":1078}}}` | The followed transaction waits | `block` is the projected block, 0 for the next; `vsize` is what is mined before it inside that block. Sent when it changes, a mere shuffle at most once per `WS_POSITION_INTERVAL_MS`, from the same pass as `tx:<txid>` ([above](#following-a-transaction-or-an-address)) |
| `{"txReplaced":{"txid":"<replacement>"}}` | It was replaced | The transaction that replaced it |
| `{"txConfirmed":"<txid>"}` | It was mined | |
| `{"address-transactions":[…]}` | `track-address`: transactions paying or spending it entered the mempool | The node's Esplora JSON for each, as `GET /api/tx/:txid` serves it |
| `{"block-transactions":[…]}` | `track-address`: transactions of it confirmed | As above |
| `{"multi-address-transactions":{"<address>":{"mempool":[…],"confirmed":[…],"removed":[]}}}` | `track-addresses`: the same events | One address per message, written as the server writes it (bech32 in lower case); `removed` is always empty |
| `{"<key>-error":"…"}` | `track-tx`, `track-address` or `track-addresses` over a limit below | The socket stays. What the message asked to stop is stopped: a refused `track-tx` or `track-address` has still ended the previous one, and a `track-addresses` set keeps the addresses the server could take |

A part wanted, or a transaction followed, gets its current message at once (a transaction gets none while no message applies: not seen yet, evicted). An address gets nothing until it changes, as on the reference. After a reconnect, send everything again.

**Addresses.** When an address is first followed, the server reads its newest history page once from the node (up to 50 mempool and the 25 newest confirmed transactions, `/scripthash/:hash/txs`) and says nothing: that is what the client could already see. On each change of the node's Electrum status for it, the server reads the page again and sends what is new in it. One read per address and change, whatever the number of sockets; changes during a read make one more read; at most two reads per network at once, each counted until the node answers or 60 s pass, as the address routes' calls are ([`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) rule 11), and capped at 8 MB. A read still waiting its turn is dropped when no socket follows the address any more. So more than 50 mempool or 25 confirmed transactions between two changes are not all sent, and a transaction that leaves the mempool unconfirmed is not said. An address the node will not watch (more history than its `--max-sh-creates`) gets no messages; `/app/ws` says why, this socket does not.

### Limits

Every rule in [Connection rules](#connection-rules) applies, with the same settings and close codes, except the socket counts:

| Rule | Default | Setting |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/v1/ws` sockets open at once, every network together | 256 | `WS_V1_MAX_SOCKETS` |
| `/api/v1/ws` sockets per client address | 4 | `WS_V1_CLIENT_MAX_SOCKETS` |

They are pools of their own: a compatible socket never takes one of `WS_MAX_SOCKETS` or a client's `WS_CLIENT_MAX_SOCKETS`, and the reverse. Over a cap at upgrade, `503` or `429` as for `/app/ws`, logged with `refused` `v1_server_sockets` or `v1_client_sockets`.

Per socket, the parts wanted count inside `WS_MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS`; the `track-tx` transaction inside `WS_MAX_TRACKED_TXS`; the `track-address` address and the `track-addresses` set together inside `WS_MAX_TRACKED_ADDRESSES` (2; the reference allows 10). Over it, `track-addresses` is answered `track-addresses-error` and changes nothing; `track-tx` and `track-address` answer `track-tx-error` and `track-address-error`. Past the network's `WS_TRACKED_TXS_TOTAL` or `WS_TRACKED_ADDRESSES_TOTAL`, shared with `/app/ws`, the same keys say the server is full, for the transaction or each address it could not take. A message is at most `WS_MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES` (1,024 bytes, about twenty addresses).

### Why other sites may open it

`/app/ws` refuses another site's page ([`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) rule 21), because that page could otherwise open sockets from each of its visitors until their allowance was used up and lock them out of our pages. A public API socket is meant to be opened from other sites, so the same attack is closed another way: its sockets come from the pools above. Another site can use up a visitor's 4 compatible sockets, and with enough visitors all 256, but never one `/app/ws` socket, so our pages keep working. Each pool bounds its own memory and file descriptors.

### Differences from the reference

| What | Here | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Frames | One part per message | The reference puts several in one frame (a block with `mempool-blocks`, `fees`, `da`, `txConfirmed`, …). Each of ours is encoded once and shared by every subscriber; bundling would mean a frame per combination. A client reads every key of every message |
| `blocks`, `block` | The node's Esplora JSON: no `extras`, no `stale` | The extras come from our block table after the block arrives; waiting for them would break the block budget ([`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md#performance-budgets)). Who mined a block and its fees are in [`API.md`](API.md#mining), its audit in [Block audits](API.md#block-audits). Only best-chain blocks are sent |
| `vBytesPerSecond` | Absent | Not computed yet |
| `mempoolInfo` | rbitcoin's `getmempoolinfo`: has `fullrbf`, `limitclustercount`, `limitclustersize`; no `permitbaremultisig`, `maxdatacarriersize` or `optimal` | The node's own answer |
| `stats` cadence | Every 2 s | The reference sends about once a second; `WS_MEMPOOL_INTERVAL_MS` bounds every mempool topic |
| `transactions` | `vsize` is the sigop-adjusted integer | The tracker's unit |
| `txPosition` | No `cpfp`; sent when it changes | The CPFP details are `GET /app/tx/:txid/relatives`; the reference repeats the position in every stats frame |
| `txConfirmed` | Its own message | As above |
| Transactions in address messages | The node's Esplora JSON, without the reference's own fields (`order`, `vsize`, `adjustedVsize`, `feePerVsize`, `adjustedFeePerVsize`, `effectiveFeePerVsize`, `firstSeen`, `cpfpDirty`, `clusterId`, `chunkIndex`, `cpfpChecked`, …) | Passed through from the node, never rebuilt |
| `track-addresses` | 2 addresses per socket by default | Each address is a node subscription; raise `WS_MAX_TRACKED_ADDRESSES` to allow more |
| `multi-address-transactions` | One address per message; `removed` always empty | Each address's message is encoded once for every socket following it |
| Not served | `init`, `refresh-blocks`, `live-2h-chart`, `conversions`, `loadingIndicators`, `backend`, the replacement feeds (`rbfLatest`, `rbfSummary`, …), `track-txs`, `track-mempool*`, `track-mempool-block`, `utxoSpent`, `address-removed-transactions`, `rbfTransaction`, `rbfInfo` | Status and reason per message in [`compat/websocket.md`](compat/websocket.md) |

### Cost of a compatible socket

A compatible socket costs what an `/app/ws` socket costs: every message is encoded once per network and each socket's queue holds references to the same bytes. Nothing it sends reaches the node except following an address, which reads one history page per change of the address, shared by every socket following it.

Measured locally on the release build against the regtest node (Apple M4 shared with other work, clients in Bun on the same machine), every socket wanting `blocks`, `stats` and `mempool-blocks` and following the same transaction and address, under the same activity in each step (a payment to the address every 15 s, a block a minute), 60 s a step:

| Sockets | Server CPU | Server RSS | Sent to clients | RPC calls a minute | Address reads a minute |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.05% of one core | 8 MB | 1.2 KB/s | 29–37 | 5 |
| 100 | 0.15% | 9 MB | 131 KB/s | 29–37 | 5 |
| 1,000 | 1.0% | 15 MB | 1.3 MB/s | 29–37 | 5 |

The node's work does not change with the sockets: the RPC calls are the mempool tracker's, and the address is read once per payment or block whatever the number of sockets following it. Memory grows by about 6 KB a socket. No socket was dropped.

**Against the reference, on mainnet,** 2026-11-12, 15 minutes and three blocks (975,542 to 975,544): our server read-only against a synced node with the mempool engine on, one client to it and one to mempool.space's socket, each wanting every part and following the same transaction and its address.

| | Here | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| `block`, after the reference's | +0.43 s, +2.5 s, −0.63 s | |
| Of which our own wait | 0.9 s each: the node's Esplora had not caught up with its announcement, as for `/app/ws` | |
| The tracked transaction's `block-transactions` and `txConfirmed`, after the reference's | +0.46 s and +1.3 s | In the `block` frame |
| First `mempool-blocks` on the new block, after its `block` | 3.7 to 4.2 s | In the same frame |
| `stats` | one per 2.0 s | one per 1.1 s |
| Traffic for these parts | 1.7 KB/s | 3.5 KB/s |

Shapes matched as the conformance test says, and only where the table of differences says. The `mempool-blocks` on a new block waits for the fee task's next projection read and then this socket's own, each once per `WS_MEMPOOL_INTERVAL_MS`; `/app/ws` sends its projection about 2 s after the block. The whole server, engines included, used 3.3% of one core and 83 MB.

## How it works

- **Fan-out.** A topic message is encoded once into a complete WebSocket frame (header and payload) held behind a reference count. Sending it to a subscriber puts a reference on that subscriber's bounded queue; the subscriber's writer puts the same bytes on the wire. Nothing is copied or encoded per connection.
- **Cost per connection** is one task, its queue and its subscriptions: about 5 KB of server memory measured with 5,000 open sockets, plus kernel socket buffers. Memory grows linearly with connections. Queued messages are shared, so a full queue costs 64 references, not 64 copies.
- **Cost per message** is one `O(subscribers)` pass of non-blocking queue pushes under the topic's lock, then one write per subscriber on its own task. Measured: about 2 ms to queue a block to 5,000 sockets, and about 35 ms until 5,000 local clients had all read it.
- **Upstream work is shared and capped.** No client message reaches the node, but for following an address, which joins one shared Electrum subscription per address, capped per network with requests in flight counted. The only other upstream calls are the block fetch for each new block, made by one task per network (normally one request, at most 120), the block's summary, computed once by the summary routes' own capped worker, and the mempool engine's polling, which runs whatever the number of subscribers. The full fetch is also the existence check, since a missing block is a short 404 and a separate check would add a round trip once the block is there. `hello` and the snapshots come from memory.
- **Mempool topics** are produced by one task per network that reads the latest projection, compares each block with what it last published, and encodes each message once. A topic's stored state for new subscribers is its last snapshot plus the deltas appended since; after 16 deltas, or when they outweigh the snapshot, they are folded into a fresh snapshot, which is stored but sent to nobody.
- **Shutdown.** Every socket is sent `1001` and given up to `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS`, counted from the signal, to finish, together with the HTTP connections. Sockets still open then are dropped, and the server waits for them to release their slots.
- **Behind TLS.** The reverse proxy must pass `Upgrade` and `Connection` through (nginx: `proxy_http_version 1.1`, `proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade`, `proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade"`), pass `Host` through for the origin check above and keep idle connections open longer than `WS_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS / 2`, the ping interval. The page connects to `wss://` on its own host, which the Content-Security-Policy's `default-src 'self'` allows in current Chromium and Firefox. Older WebKit did not match `ws:`/`wss:` with `'self'` ([WebKit bug 201591](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201591)); if a Safari user cannot connect, that is the cause.

## Conformance

The server side of RFC 6455 (handshake, framing, masking, fragmentation, control frames, close, SHA-1 and base64 for the accept key) is our own code in `ws/frame.rs` and `ws.rs`, about 300 lines in place of a library and its 22 crates. Two checks hold it to the standard:

- **[Autobahn TestSuite](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-testsuite)**, the standard conformance suite, run by `dev/autobahn/autobahn.py`. It builds the server with the `autobahn` feature, which makes the hub echo text messages and skip `hello`, raises the size, rate and queue limits to the most the config allows, and runs every case in Docker against it. It takes about a minute, too slow for CI: rerun it after changing `ws/`.
- **A fuzz test** in the normal test suite (`the_parser_survives_random_and_mutated_streams`) feeds 50,000 generated byte streams through the reader: valid and invalid frames, truncation, bit flips, absurd and non-minimal lengths, missing masks, interleaved control frames and fragments that never end. Each must end in a defined close code, and no payload buffer may exceed the message limit (or 125 bytes for a control frame). It takes about 0.6 s.

Autobahn results, 2026-11-12, every case:

| Cases | OK | Non-strict | Informational | Unimplemented | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 Framing | 8 | | | | 8 |
| 2 Ping and pong | 11 | | | | |
| 3 Reserved bits | 5 | 2 | | | |
| 4 Opcodes | 6 | 4 | | | |
| 5 Fragmentation | 19 | 1 | | | |
| 6 UTF-8 | 141 | 4 | | | |
| 7 Close | 34 | | 3 | | |
| 9 Large messages | 15 | | | | 39 |
| 10 Auto-fragmentation | 1 | | | | |
| 12, 13 Compression | | | | 216 | |
| **All** | **240** | **11** | **3** | **216** | **47** |

No case shows a protocol violation. The rest, and why each stays:

| Result | Cases | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Failed | 1.2.*, and the binary cases of 9.* | Binary messages are refused with `1003` by design; the suite expects them echoed |
| Failed | The 9.* cases over 1 MiB, the most `WS_MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES` allows | Refused with `1009` from the frame header. When the suite is still sending (8 and 16 MiB), the server has stopped reading and drops the connection, so the suite never sees the close frame. RFC 6455 section 7.1.7 lets an endpoint that fails a connection stop processing data |
| Non-strict | 3.2, 3.3, 4.1.3, 4.1.4, 4.2.3, 4.2.4, 5.15 | A valid message, then a broken frame. The connection closes with `1002` without echoing the valid message first, because the close frame goes ahead of queued messages. Strict order would mean flushing a queue that a slow client may have filled |
| Non-strict | 6.4.1–6.4.4 | Invalid UTF-8 in a fragmented message is caught when the message is complete, not at the fragment that broke it. The message is capped at `WS_MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES`, so the cost is reading at most that much |
| Informational | 7.1.6, 7.13.1, 7.13.2 | Behaviour the RFC leaves open: a close handled before a large earlier echo went out, and close codes 5000 and above answered with `1002` |
| Unimplemented | 12.*, 13.* | Compression (`permessage-deflate`), which the server never negotiates |

## Adding a topic

1. Add a variant to `Topic` in `crates/server/src/ws.rs` and its name to `Topic::parse` and `Topic::name`. A topic with a parameter (a tracked transaction) takes it as a parsed value in the variant, never a raw string.
2. Produce its messages in one task per network, as `feed` in `ws/hub.rs` does for `blocks` and `ws/mempool.rs` for the mempool topics: build the JSON with `serde_json` (or a binary payload with `Frame::encode`), then call `Hub::announce` (or `Hub::publish`) once per change. `Snapshot::Replace` makes the message the topic's current state for new subscribers; `Clear` and `Keep` are for messages that invalidate it or leave it alone; `Append` is for a change new subscribers must also get after the state, and `Hub::set_snapshot` folds those into a new state without sending it. `announce` logs a `ws_fanout` line per message: use `publish` and a periodic summary for a topic that sends every few seconds.
3. If the topic needs upstream work per subscribed value, start it on the first subscriber and stop it on the last, through the shared, capped Electrum subscriptions ([`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) rule 10), and add its own per-connection cap. A topic family with a parameter that costs more to send (`projected-txs:N`) also gets a per-connection cap.
4. Rate-limit a topic whose source changes often, and keep each message bounded in size.
5. Document it here under Topics, with how a client recovers from a missed message, and its cost.
