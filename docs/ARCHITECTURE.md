# Architecture

rbitcoin.space is a sidecar: one Rust server beside a stock rbitcoin node, a static frontend, and a SQLite file per network. It does not embed or patch the node.

```text
 browser ──HTTP/WS──► rbitcoin-space ─Esplora REST──► rbitcoin v0.9.2
                        │   │   │  ──Electrum TCP──►   (unmodified)
                        │   │   └──JSON-RPC────────►
                        │   └── SQLite (derived data only)
                        └── LDK gossip peer ──► Lightning network
```

## Principles

1. **The node is the source of truth.** Anything rbitcoin can answer is asked of rbitcoin, never copied into our own store. Blocks, transactions, addresses and spends stay in the node.
2. **We store only derived or observed data:** per-block mining summaries, mempool history, Lightning graph history, prices.
3. **Push where the node pushes, poll where it does not.** Blocks and tracked scripts arrive by Electrum subscription. The mempool is polled, because rbitcoin has no mempool event stream ([`RBITCOIN.md`](RBITCOIN.md)).
4. **Clients are untrusted.** The browser never reaches the node directly. Every request goes through typed, bounded handlers ([`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)).
5. **Compatibility is a bonus, not a constraint.** We serve rbitcoin's Esplora API as it is, and mempool.space-shaped endpoints where they are cheap. Where rbitcoin lets us do better, we do it our own way ([`COMPAT.md`](COMPAT.md)).

## Rust workspace

| Crate | Path | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| `rbitcoin-space` (binary) | `crates/server` | Config, HTTP routes, WebSocket hub, middleware, static file serving, wiring |
| `node` | `crates/node` | Typed clients for rbitcoin: Esplora (TCP and unix socket), Electrum with subscriptions, JSON-RPC |
| `engine` | `crates/engine` | Mempool tracking, projected blocks, block summaries, the SQLite store. Pure logic is kept separate from I/O so it can be unit-tested |
| `ln` | `crates/ln` | The gossip-only LDK peer and Lightning graph tracking |
| `logging` | `crates/logging` | Typed log events, their catalogue and the non-blocking writer ([`LOGGING.md`](LOGGING.md)). Only the server emits; libraries report through values |

Dependencies point one way: `server` → `engine` and `ln` → `node`, and only `server` uses `logging`. A crate may be split when it earns it, not before.

Runtime is tokio with axum. SQLite is accessed through `rusqlite` with the bundled library.

## Networks

One process serves every configured network. Each network gets its own context: node clients, engine, SQLite file. They share nothing mutable, so a failing network does not affect the others.

A network is enabled by setting its variables (`.env.example`). Mainnet is served at the root; other networks under a prefix:

| Network | Pages | APIs |
|---|---|---|
| Mainnet | `/…` | `/api/…`, `/app/…` |
| Signet | `/signet/…` | `/signet/api/…`, `/signet/app/…` |
| Testnet4 | `/testnet4/…` | `/testnet4/api/…`, `/testnet4/app/…` |
| Regtest | `/regtest/…` | `/regtest/api/…`, `/regtest/app/…` |

## HTTP surface

| Prefix | Contract | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/*` | Esplora REST, as rbitcoin serves it | Passed through an allow-list of routes with typed parameters. Public and stable |
| `/api/v1/*` | mempool.space-shaped subset | Only the endpoints listed as served in [`COMPAT.md`](COMPAT.md) |
| `/app/*` | Private API for our frontend | May change in any release; the frontend and server ship together |
| `/app/ws` | WebSocket for live updates | See below |
| `/api/v1/ws` | mempool.space-shaped WebSocket | For wallets and bots; the same hub ([`WS.md`](WS.md#the-mempoolspace-shaped-socket-apiv1ws)) |
| `/healthz` | Liveness | No upstream calls |
| everything else | The frontend | Static files from a configured directory, with the app shell as fallback |

Confirmed data that can no longer change (a block or transaction buried deep enough) is served with long-lived cache headers so a reverse proxy or CDN can absorb it.

## Live updates

One WebSocket per browser tab.

- **Text frames (JSON)** carry control messages and small state: subscribe, unsubscribe, track a transaction or address, new block, mempool totals, fee recommendations.
- **Binary frames** carry projected-block transaction data as fixed-width records, sent as deltas (added, removed, changed) after an initial snapshot.
- The server computes each update once and fans the same bytes out to every subscriber.
- Every connection has a bounded send queue. A client that cannot keep up is dropped, never buffered without limit.

The protocol, its topics and its limits are in [`WS.md`](WS.md).

## Mempool tracking

1. Poll `getrawmempool` with `mempool_sequence` and diff the txid set against the last one.
2. Fetch details only for new txids, in JSON-RPC batches.
3. Take every chunk of every cluster from the node (`getmempoolcluster`, asked again only for clusters that changed), and pack them into projected blocks by the node's own template rule, instead of linearizing clusters ourselves.
4. Classify removals: confirmed, replaced (naming the replacement) or evicted.

The tracker's and the projected blocks' design, cadence and accuracy limits are in [`MEMPOOL.md`](MEMPOOL.md); node costs in [`RBITCOIN.md`](RBITCOIN.md).

## Storage

One SQLite file per network, in WAL mode.

- **One writer task** owns all writes. API handlers read through separate read-only connections.
- **Migrations** are numbered SQL files applied in order, tracked with `user_version`.
- **Everything derivable is rebuildable.** Dropping the file loses only what was observed live: mempool history, block audits (with the first-seen times they list) and the replacement record.

## Frontend

Solid with TypeScript, built by Vite into static files. No server rendering and no Node at runtime.

- **Routes** mirror the network prefixes above.
- **State** comes from the WebSocket for anything live and from HTTP for everything else.
- **Rendering:** block and mempool views are drawn with WebGL2 instanced quads; charts use uPlot.
- **Styling:** design tokens as CSS custom properties, no CSS-in-JS runtime ([`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md)).

## Performance budgets

| What | Budget |
|---|---|
| First load, JavaScript | 100 KB gzipped for the app shell and home page |
| New block, from the node's Electrum announcement to the `block` message on the WebSocket | 50 ms on a node with rbitcoin PR 1577 (measured 11–43 ms on mainnet and signet). rbitcoin v0.9.2 can hold a new block for a second or more after announcing it ([`RBITCOIN.md`](RBITCOIN.md)): there the budget runs from when the node can serve the block, plus at most an eighth of the hold, the hub's retry spacing |
| Cached or immutable API response, server time | 10 ms at p99 |
| Frame rate during block and mempool animations | 60 fps on a mid-range laptop |

A change that breaks a budget needs a stated reason in its PR.

## Deployment

The deliverable is a Docker image and a compose file that runs the server next to rbitcoin. On the same host the server can use rbitcoin's unix sockets, which unlocks the bulk `/internal/*` Esplora routes. TLS is terminated by a reverse proxy.
